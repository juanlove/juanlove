HOLY SHIT!!!... Just when I thought this site was FINALLY done these fckers find something else to bitch about.. and they have the audacity to act surprised when shit doesn't work the way they want it. They just don't fcking listen.. I say give me a 5sec clip for the thumbnail. I get a THIRTY second clip. So I crop the damn thing myself and he goes "why was it shortened." Because I SAID FIVE SECONDS! You know how huge a 30 sec gif would be especially for the size and resolution you want it. No? Well I do.. and the answer is too fcking much! That was just one example of seeeveerraall.

Now everything is done, but he wants to add a watermark to one of the video backgrounds. I'm like no problem. He does it. I get it. Then compress it for web. I push the update to the site and I actually thought I was done. Ha.. How silly of me. I get an email for revision.. ? ? NANI ? ?

"Hey it looks aggressively more compressed" Meaning too low quality. I was like hmm.. I might of fcked up but how? Videos should be identical. All that was added was a watermark. Fps is the same. Same dimensions. Lengt... HE ADDED 10 MORE SECONDS! How can someone be this duuumb.

FUCK ARTISTS! Is this what racism feels like??? Irrationally hating an entire group due to the actions of a single person? Because I am pretty sure I never want to design for an "artist" ever again. Look dumb-ass. It is just a website. Not a canvas to splatter your ambiguity. It is there to provide function, not feelings. I don't want to meet the person that visits this site and says, "Wow. This website really speaks to me". Yeah no shit. It's saying, "this is how you can contact this person", you fcking retard.
